LORE HISTORY
In their own universe Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was extensive kingdom located in the continent named Europe. Though one day citizens of Commonwealth woke up to a new reality. There were no Muscovites, no Swedes and no Ottomans. Instead their country was surrounded by lizards, walking dead, and the neighbours that were actually human were sewing their dying into monstrosities for some reason. How the united nations will fare in this new, weird reality?
