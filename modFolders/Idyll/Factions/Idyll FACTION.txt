LORE NAME:
Remnant of Idyll

LORE MAIN RACE:
Elementals

LORE HISTORY:
When the Wild is succesful at bringing nature back to an area, and the area prospers year after year without interruption, the Wilds become peaceful once more. The creatures of Idyll represent balance between life and the four elements.

LORE CULTURE:
Elves, which are humans transformed by the ritual of the Wild, always have an animalistic mind - but nowhere is this clearer than in Idyll. They start to live like animals, roaming the lands mindlessly. Though Idyll is centered around peace and balance, it still is ready to fight if it becomes threatened.

LORE HERO FIGHTER:
Naturalists live under the open sky, year by year, becoming attuned to nature

LORE HERO CASTER:
Channelers let the elements run through them, connecting all four elements at once
