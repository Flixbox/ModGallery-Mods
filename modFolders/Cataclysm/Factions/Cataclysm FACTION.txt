LORE NAME:
Infernal Cataclysm

LORE MAIN RACE:
The Dead

LORE HISTORY:
The humanoid spirits were enslaved by the animal spirits due to their inability to fight back, but their faith have summoned the god Keiki and she brought her Haniwa army to liberate the humans, both the haniwas and the beast spirits are at war. The 3 animal clans have joined forces in order to defeat the haniwa

LORE CULTURE:
The beast spirits believe in 'survival of the fittest', with that, they enslaved the weaker humanoid spirits. The haniwa exert far too much control, meaning you don't get to do much, as the haniwa will do everything and anything.

LORE HERO FIGHTER:
The beast leaders are the clan's respective matriarchs, none of them really like one another, but they joined forces anyways.

LORE HERO CASTER:
The god Keiki and her created haniwa lead their armies into battle!
