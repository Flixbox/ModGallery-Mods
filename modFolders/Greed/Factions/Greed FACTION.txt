Profiteers are the most powerful servants of the rulers of the Cult of Greed. They are the ones not arfaid to make their hands a little dirty in pursiut of further wealth.

LORE HERO CASTER:
The Magnates are the ruling class of the Cult of Greed. They are the ones driving the cult to excess and beyond.
